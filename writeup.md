Colket Dining Room Table

As Currently Configured: 120" long x 48" wide with 10 chairs (21" each),
4 each on long side and 1 on each end. There is also one leaf that is
18"x 48" which would extend the length to 138".

Goal: To shorten the table to accommodate seating for 6, 2 chairs each
on long side and 1 on each end. Also want to accommodate seating for 8,
3 chairs each on long side and 1 on each end.

Because of scalloped apron design, the table could be shortened by
either 18" or 27" (9" or 13.5" from either side)

Options:

A.  Shorten by 18" to 102"

B.  Shorten by 27" to 93"

C.  Option A increased to 120" with existing leaf

D.  Option B increased to 111" with existing leaf

E.  Option A increased to 138" with existing leaf + new 18" leaf

F.  Option B increased to 129" with existing leaf + new 18" leaf

Additional Options:

- If table is shortened to 93", consider making an additional leaf that
  is 27" which would configure table back to 120"

Drawings Needed:

1.  6 chairs on 102" table

2.  6 chairs on 93" table

3.  8 chairs on 111" table (93 + 18)

4.  8 chairs on 93" table (?)

5.  10 chairs on 120\" table (existing configuration)
